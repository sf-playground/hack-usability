# Similar vertical characters: 1, l, i, |, I

## Usability considerations

- Primary concern is that the character is recognizable within context.
- Secondary concern is that the character is recognizable stand-alone.
- `1` is expected to have a downward slope to the 'nose'
- the pipe character `|` is used to draw vertical lines (in interfaces, or console output)
- the pipe character is used as a separator in regular expressions

## Comments and issues

- [#43](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/issues/43): the number `1` looks too much like a lowercase `l`.

## Examples

- TODO Visual examples of stand-alone characters at different type-sizes.
- TODO Examples where these characters cause confusion within a context.
- TODO Comparison to other typefaces.
