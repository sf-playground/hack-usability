# Usability TODO

## Short term topics of interest

- [ ] How are the various types of brackets aligned to the content they wrap?
  - [ ] TODO separate this topic in sub-issues

## Neverending list of things to research

- [ ] Research (and document) programming language syntaxes to increase general knowledge on these subjects and to create a proper collection of (common) patterns, keywords, etc.
  - [ ] Javascript/Coffeescript
  - [ ] Python (@ https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html)
  - [ ] CSS
  - [ ] HTML
  - [ ] C(++)
  - [ ] Ruby
  - [ ] Java
  - [ ] Markdown
- [ ] Define subsets of ascii-characters, and describe their purpose and relationship to each other; all other glyphs should technically be able to be linked to these subsets
- [ ] Research the different uses of the punctuation characters in ascii, and to what other characters they most often relate
- [ ] Compare various often used (programming) typefaces and how the subsets of ascii-characters relate to eachother
- [ ] Compare various typefaces visually; spacing, alignment, identity, etc.
- [ ] Create a set of guidelines which all ascii-glyphs should follow; this ranges from minimum sizes of features in glyphs, to a definition of what a character does, and why it adheres to certain alignment rules for instance.
- [ ] Research distinguishness of ascii-characters within Hack (in all supported typesizes), and compare as such to other typefaces
- [ ] Do something with the results of the raw token analysis by @chris
- [ ] Discuss and collect the gut-feelings changes @chrissimpkins has made when he started with Hack.
