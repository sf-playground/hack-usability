# Usability TODO

- [ ] Research (and document) programming language syntaxes to increase general knowledge on these subjects and to create a proper collection of (common) patterns, keywords, etc.
  - [ ] Javascript / Coffeescript
  - [ ] Python
  - [ ] CSS
  - [ ] HTML
  - [ ] C(++)
  - [ ] Ruby
  - [ ] Java
  - [ ] Markdown
- [ ] Define subsets of ascii-characters, and describe their purpose and relationship to each other; all other glyphs should technically be able to be linked to these subsets
- [ ] Research the different uses of the punctuation characters in ascii, and to what other characters they most often relate
- [ ] Compare various often used (programming) typefaces and how the subsets of ascii-characters relate to eachother
- [ ] Compare various typefaces visually; spacing, alignment, identity, etc.
- [ ] Create a set of guidelines which all ascii-glyphs should follow; this ranges from minimum sizes of features in glyphs, to a definition of what a character does, and why it adheres to certain alignment rules for instance.
- [ ] Research distinguishness of ascii-characters within Hack (in all supported typesizes), and compare as such to other typefaces
- [ ] Do something with the results of the raw token analysis by @chris
